        "This was my first time getting Kitty Kurlz for my 12-week-old kitten, Ghost Pepper, and he was obsessed. He literally batted it around for almost 2 hours, which is wild because most toys only keep his attention for a few minutes. I've been worried about him getting lonely when I'm working, so it's such a relief to see him entertained and happy. Honestly, if he could talk I swear he'd be like, 'Mom, don't you dare take this toy away from me.' ðŸ˜‚ Definitely one of the best things I've bought for him.",

        "I haven't even opened the toy yet, but I'm already super impressed by their service. Shipping was fast, and when I messaged customer support to change my delivery address (since packages sometimes get stolen out here), they immediately jumped on the phone and took care of everything.",
        "5/5 for customer support. It's rare to see a small company genuinely care like this. Highly recommend!",
