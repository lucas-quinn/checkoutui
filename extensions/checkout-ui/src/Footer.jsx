        "This was my first time getting Kitty Kurlz for my 12-week-old kitten, Ghost Pepper, and he was obsessed. He literally batted it around for almost 2 hours, which is wild because most toys only keep his attention for a few minutes. I've been worried about him getting lonely when I'm working, so it's such a relief to see him entertained and happy. Honestly, if he could talk I swear he'd be like, 'Mom, don't you dare take this toy away from me.' ðŸ˜‚ Definitely one of the best things I've bought for him.",
